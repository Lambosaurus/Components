# Modules
Assorted embedded software modules.

These are broken down into the following catagories
* Parts: Drivers for various IC's and Parts
* Utils: Modules useful for common tasks

In general, these will be bits and bobs that I wish to re-use, and will be targeted at my STM32X base.
Stability or dependance on a particular STM32X library cannot be guaranteed - though I will try my best.
